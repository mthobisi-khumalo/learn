Develop a web application (Application 1) using Spring MVC and JSP for Library Management. 
A librarian can login to application and manage books. 
However, the details of the books and authors are maintained on a separate server (Application 2) which exposes RESTful webservices using Spring Boot to support CRUD operations on books data.
A book must be associated with an author. 
Authors needs to be configured in Database (not to be added through UI). 
While adding a book, authors will be shown in the dropdown to choose from the list.
REST APIs for CRUD operations on Author has to be provided, however no separate UI is needed for Author Management.

Following functionalities are expected

Librarian Login/Logout
Books listing
Add a book
Edit a book details
REST APIs for CRUD operations on authors data
REST APIs for CRUD operations on books data
